<h3 class="heading-titles"> Mission Statement </h3>
<p class="paragraph">The goal of LEAFS is to help inspire youth with disabilities to find their passion, by interacting with several STEM based activities, promoting a more inclusive environment and developing diversity in thought for future engineers to tackle tomorrow’s most challenging technological problems.</p>
<h3 class="heading-titles"> Tentative Dates </h3>
<p class="paragraph"> Saturdays in Spring 2020:<br/>April 3rd<br/>April 10th</p>
<h3 class="heading-titles"> Location </h3>
<p class="paragraph">Due to the ongoing pandemic, LEAFS will be fully online this year. You can attend this camp from anywhere with an internet address and an Oregon mailing address to get your materials kit!</p>
<h3 class="heading-titles"> How to Apply </h3>
<p class="paragraph">Check out the “Apply” tab in the navigation bar, above! Please fill out the google form with the applicants information. Also, we encourage you to create a short video with the activities listed to help us get to know you</p>
<h3 class="heading-titles"> Additional Information </h3>
<p class="paragraph">Leading and Enabling Adolescent Futures in STEM (LEAFS) is a two-day outreach program that takes place in the spring. For two consecutive Saturdays, the project team, led by the Adaptive Technologies Engineering Network (ATEN), will bring disabled youth into welcoming online learning spaces provided by Oregon State University.
Before the program begins, kits of hands on materials will be shipped to the participant's address. For each of the Saturdays, there will be a new initial learning session followed by a hands-on building application using the home science kit. During this learning session the project team will go over the science and applications that will be used during the building session. It will be a time for students to learn and ask questions about how they can apply Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) principles to everyday problems.
After the lecture session, the participants will break out into groups to start working on that day’s hands-on activities, which are listed below. Participants will also be surveyed on likes/dislikes about the curriculum for continuous improvement of the program.
Each week there will be a two different parts of STEM explored. The four main themes will be chemistry, civil engineering, introduction to programming, and mechanical engineering.</p>
<h3 class="heading-titles"> How LEAFS Started </h3>
<p class="paragraph">In 2017/2018, we received a grant from the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) making the start of LEAFS possible. ATEN has continued to host a yearly LEAFS since then. </p>
<h3 class="heading-titles"> Program Activites </h3>
<p class="paragraph"> Four different activities that will expand knowledge of different field in STEM. These include building a model catapult, programming with scratch and arduino, and more.
