          <h3> Mission Statement </h3>
          <p> The goal of LEAFS is to help inspire
          youths with disabilities to find their passion
          by interacting with several STEM based activities. 
          Promoting a more inclusive environment and developing
          diversity in thought for future engineers to tackle
          tomorrow’s most challenging technological problems is our focus.

        <h3 class="heading-titles"> Additional Information </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Leading and Enabling Adolescent Futures in STEM (LEAFS) is a four-day outreach program that takes place in the fall. For four consecutive Saturdays, the project team, led by the Adaptive Technologies Engineering Network (ATEN), will bring disabled youth into the learning spaces provided by Oregon State University.
        For each of the Saturdays, there will be a new initial learning session followed by a hands-on building application. During this learning session the project team will go over the science and applications that will be used during the building session. It will be a time for students to learn and ask questions about how they can apply Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) principles to everyday problems.
        After the lecture session, the participants will break out into groups to start working on that day’s hands-on activities, which are listed below. After completion of the activity, a Q&A session will be conducted to see what the students learned that day. Participants will also be surveyed on likes/dislikes about the curriculum for continuous improvement of the program.
        Each week there will be a different part of STEM explored. The four main activities will be buckyball creation, creating a solar panel car, introduction to programming, and 3D modeling with 3D printing.</p>
        <h3 class="heading-titles"> How LEAFS Started </h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> We received a grant from the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) making this all possible. </p>
        <h3 class="heading-titles"> Program Activites </h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> Four different activities that will expand knowledge of different field in STEM. These include building a solar car, learning about buckminsterfullerene, programming with scratch and arduino, and designing and printing a 3D model.
