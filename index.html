          <h3> Mission Statement </h3>
          <p> The goal of LEAFS is to help inspire
          youths with disabilities to find their passion
          by interacting with several STEM based activities.
          Promoting a more inclusive environment and developing
          diversity in thought for future engineers to tackle
          tomorrow’s most challenging technological problems.

        <h3 class="heading-titles"> Activities </h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> Four different activities that will expand knowledge of different fields in STEM. These include building a model catapult, exploring photocatalytic (light absorbing) chemical reactions in nature and photography, programming with scratch and arduino, andcivil engineering activites.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Each week we will explore two different aspects of STEM. The four main activities will be working with photocatalytic reactions, creating a model catapult, introducing programming, and civil engineering.

        <h3 class="heading-titles"> More Info </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Leading and Enabling Adolescent Futures in STEM (LEAFS) is a two-day outreach program taking place in Spring 2021. During two consecutive Saturdays, the project team, led by the Adaptive Technology Engineering Network (ATEN), will bring disabled youth into learning spaces provided by Oregon State University to foster their interest in STEM fields.</p>


        <p class="paragraph">For each of the Saturdays, there will be a new initial learning session followed by a hands-on building application. During this learning session, the project team will go over the science and applications that will be used during the building session. It will be a time for students to learn and ask questions about how they can apply Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) principles to everyday problems.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">After the lecture session, the participants will break out into groups to start working on that day’s hands-on activities, which are listed below. After completion of the activity, a Q&A session will be conducted to see what the students learned that day. Participants will also be surveyed on what they liked/disliked about the activities, in order to keep improving the program.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-titles"> How it Started </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">OSU graduate student Matt Harrison thought of the program in 2017. This led him to apply for, and receive, a grant from the <a class="green-link" href="https://www.ieeefoundation.org/epics">Engineering Projects In Community Service</a> (EPICS) program through the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for the merit and impact of his ideas. The Adaptive Technologies Engineering Network (ATEN), a new club formed in the fall of 2017 at OSU, was invited to work on building the website and helping with the activities.</p>
        <h3 class="heading-titles"> Diversity Statement </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Oregon State University Extension Service prohibits discrimination in all its programs, services, activities, and materials on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity (including gender expression), sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, familial/parental status, income derived from a public assistance program, political beliefs, genetic information, veteran’s status, reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity.
