          <p> The goal of LEAFS is to help inspire
          youths with disabilities to find their passion
          by interacting with several STEM based activities.
          Promoting a more inclusive environment and developing
          diversity in thought for future engineers to tackle
          tomorrow’s most challenging technological problems.

        <h3 class="heading-titles"> Activities </h3>

        <p class="paragraph"> There will be two different activities that will expand on the knowledge of different fields in STEM.
        <p class="paragraph">Both activities will be done on each day of LEAFS 2022. The first activity will fall under Civil and Mechanical Engineering ideas and the second activity will fall under Programming and Electrical Engineering.

        <h3 class="heading-titles"> More Info </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Leading and Enabling Adolescent Futures in STEM (LEAFS) is a one day outreach program taking place in January 2022. On that Saturday, the project team, led by the Adaptive Technology Engineering Network (ATEN), will bring disabled youth into learning spaces provided by Oregon State University to foster their interest in STEM fields.</p>


        <p class="paragraph">At LEAFS, there will be an initial learning session followed by a hands-on building application. During this learning session, the project team will go over the science and applications that will be used during the building session. It will be a time for students to learn and ask questions about how they can apply Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) principles to everyday problems.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-titles"> How it Started </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">OSU graduate student Matt Harrison thought of the program in 2017. This led him to apply for, and receive, a grant from the <a class="green-link" href="https://www.ieeefoundation.org/epics">Engineering Projects In Community Service</a> (EPICS) program through the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for the merit and impact of his ideas. The Adaptive Technologies Engineering Network (ATEN), a new club formed in the fall of 2017 at OSU, was invited to work on building the website and helping with the activities.</p>
        <h3 class="heading-titles"> Diversity Statement </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
